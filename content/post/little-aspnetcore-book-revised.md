Last year, I published [The Little ASP.NET Core Book][book-landing], a friendly and free introduction to web programming. The book is published under a Creative Commons license, and the source is freely available [on Github][book-github].

People from all over the world have read it to learn how to build modern web applications, or just to brush up on what's new in ASP.NET Core 2.0.

Today, I'm releasing an updated version that adds brand-new content and incorporates many suggestions from readers. Keep reading to learn more, or [download a copy][book-landing]!

## Version 1.1

After getting some great [feedback][issues-all] from the community, it was clear that there was demand for an updated, revised book. I'm calling this release version 1.1, and it includes a number of changes:

* Removed the AJAX pattern to focus even more on MVC best practices
* Removed Facebook login to reduce problems for first-time readers
* Updated the Docker deployment instructions to reflect the latest practices
* A new jacket design
* Many typo fixes and small suggestions!

If you're curious, you can see the [full changelog][release] on Github. The latest version is always available from [littleasp.net/book][book-landing].

## Get ready for ASP.NET Core 2.1

ASP.NET Core 2.1 is [on the horizon][roadmap], and it contains some exciting new features. After 2.1 is available, I'm planning to release another update to the book with even more new content. You can stay updated by subscribing to my <a href="http://eepurl.com/cXACob" target="_blank">email list</a>.
