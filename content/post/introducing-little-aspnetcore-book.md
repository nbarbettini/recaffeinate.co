Today I'm excited to release my side project for the last few months: the [Little ASP.NET Core Book](/book)! 

This **free** book is a short introduction to the [ASP.NET Core 2.0](https://docs.asp.net) web framework. If you've never built apps in C# or ASP.NET (or even if you have!), this book will teach you the basics of building modern, fast web applications using ASP.NET Core.

Get a free copy on the [book page](/book)!

#### Why write a free book?

I've always wanted to write and publish a technical book. I made plans last year to write a book about ASP.NET Core 1.0, but life wonderfully got in the way in the form of a wedding, a honeymoon, and a new job.

As the release date for ASP.NET Core 2.0 approached, I wanted to create something to give back to the community and help folks learn about this awesome web framework. I didn't have the time to write a full 400 page technical monster, so I decided to write a short introductory book instead.

#### Go forth and learn!

The [Little ASP.NET Core Book](/book) was born in a single caffeine-fueled weekend, followed by many short bursts of editing. My hope is that it helps you learn something new.
