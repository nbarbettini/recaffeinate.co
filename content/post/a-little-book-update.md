It's been over two months since I released the [Little ASP.NET Core Book](/book), and I've been blown away by the response!

> _"This looks great. I've been learning ASP.NET Core with scattered resources around the web, and your book seems to explain everything in a simple way." - [aesthetics1 on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15289047)_

I've been excited to see people downloading and tweeting about the book, but I'm even more excited to see people forking the content, adding suggestions, and translating it to other languages.

## Reading in your own language

A few fantastic polyglot programmers have started translating the Little ASP.NET Core Book to other (spoken) languages.

Sahin was the first to finish with a Turkish translation, [ASP.NET Core El KitabÄ±](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sahinyanlik/kisa-asp-net-core-kitabi/details). Translations to Spanish and German are in the works!

## Little updates

The Little ASP.NET Core Book is still a work-in-progress. There have been three [minor updates](https://github.com/nbarbettini/little-aspnetcore-book/releases) since the initial launch, all focused on fixing typos and adding small clarifications or suggestions sent in by readers.

I'm tracking bugs and suggestions [on GitHub](https://github.com/nbarbettini/little-aspnetcore-book/issues) and am happy to accept pull requests.

The latest version of the book is always available from this site, or the vanity URL [littleasp.net/book](http://littleasp.net/book).

## Looking ahead

So far, the updates have been minor. I'm gathering feedback for a 1.1 release of the book, where I plan to improve a couple of areas:

* Rewriting the _More features_ chapter to fully use MVC instead of jQuery
* More complete explanation of publishing to Docker
* A discussion of adding HTTPS to the production site

If you have suggestions of what you'd like to see, feel free to add them on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbarbettini/little-aspnetcore-book/issues) or in the comments below!
