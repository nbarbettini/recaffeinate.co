I love presenting to technical (and non-technical!) audiences. There's no better way to truly understand something than to teach it to someone else.

The process of breaking down a difficult topic and presenting it in a way that makes people go "aha!" is challenging, but the lightbulb moment is incredibly rewarding.

I'd love to speak to your group or conference. Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini)!
