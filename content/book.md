### The Little ASP.NET Core Book

<img src="/img/little-aspnetcore-book-mock.png" class="headshot">

I wrote this short book to help developers and people interested in web programming learn about ASP.NET Core 2.0, a new framework for building web applications and APIs.

This short (and free!) book is structured as a tutorial. You'll build an app from start to finish and learn:

* How to build a web app with the ASP.NET Core framework
* The basics of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
* How to read and write data to a database
* How to add log-in, registration, and security
* How to deploy the app to the web

Don't worry, you don't need to know anything about ASP.NET Core (or any of the above) to get started.
