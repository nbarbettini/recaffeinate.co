### The Little ASP.NET Core Book

<img src="/img/little-aspnetcore-book-mock.png" class="headshot" style="float: left">

I wrote this short book to help developers and people interested in web programming learn about ASP.NET Core 2.0, a new framework for building web applications and APIs.

This short (and free!) book is structured as a tutorial. You'll build an app from start to finish and learn:

* How to build a web app with the ASP.NET Core framework
* The basics of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
* How to read and write data to a database
* How to add log-in, registration, and security
* How to deploy the app to the web

Don't worry, you don't need to know anything about ASP.NET Core (or any of the above) to get started.

#### About the book

If you're new to programming, this book will introduce you to the patterns and concepts used to build modern web applications. You'll learn how to build a web app (and how the big pieces fit together) by building something from scratch! While this little book won't be able to cover absolutely everything you need to know about programming, it'll give you a starting point so you can learn more advanced topics.

If you already code in a backend language like Node, Python, Ruby, Go, or Java, you'll notice a lot of familiar ideas like MVC, view templates, and dependency injection. The code will be in C#, but it won't look too different from what you already know.

If you're an ASP.NET MVC developer, you'll feel right at home! ASP.NET Core adds some new tools and reuses (and simplifies) the things you already know.
