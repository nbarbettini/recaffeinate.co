I wrote this short free book to help people learn about ASP.NET Core, a new framework for building web applications and APIs.

##### Is this book for me?

If you're new to programming, already code in another backend language (like Node, Ruby, or Java), or are an ASP.NET MVC developer, this book will help you learn something new!

## A friendly introduction to web programming

> _Dear God, I wish I had this book when I was learning .NET! - Mikael_

You don't need to know anything about web programing or ASP.NET Core to get started! _The Little ASP.NET Core Book_ is structured as a tutorial. You'll build an app from start to finish and learn:

* How to build an application with the ASP.NET Core framework
* The basics of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
* How to read and write data to a database
* How to add login, registration, and security
* How to deploy the app to the web
