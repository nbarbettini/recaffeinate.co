#### Hi, I'm Nate.

I build products and teams that solve problems. I love dissecting complexity and communicating solutions in a clear, approachable way.

I've worked as a full-stack developer, technical instructor, SDK engineer, developer advocate, and technical product manager. I wrote [a free book](/book) on ASP.NET Core and was a Microsoft MVP from 2017 - 2019.

I'm the co-founder and CTO at [Cobbler](https://www.cobbler.io), where we're building a platform to help every employee get actionable insights from their budgets and spending.

Besides writing here, I've published [courses on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/nate-barbettini) and free [technical talks on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLRFyxYl_5YjpoPB1ryUbrCM7tmKFUNBV). You can follow me on Twitter ([@nbarbettini](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini)) to get notified whenever I publish anything new.
