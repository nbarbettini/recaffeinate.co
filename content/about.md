### Hi, I'm Nate.

<img src="/img/headshot.jpg" class="headshot" style="float: left">

I'm an author, speaker, and self-taught developer who specializes in full-stack .NET and JavaScript. I'm passionate about helping people learn how to write clean, secure code. I'm currently a Senior Developer Advocate at [Okta](https://developer.okta.com), which gives me the opportunity to travel and speak about building secure applications.

If you want to learn about ASP.NET Core, check out my video course [Deploying ASP.NET Core Applications](https://www.lynda.com/ASP-NET-tutorials/Deploying-ASP-NET-Core-Applications/513606-2.html) on Lynda, or ask me a question on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini). I also answer questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3191599/nate-barbettini).

I'd be happy to speak at your company or meetup. Get in touch on Twitter or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbarbettini/)!
