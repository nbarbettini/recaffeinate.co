#### Hi, I'm Nate.

I'm an author, speaker, and self-taught developer who talks about .NET, JavaScript, and security. I'm passionate about helping people learn how to write clean, secure code.

<div class="clear"></div>

I'm currently a Product Manager at [Okta](https://developer.okta.com), where I help build tools that make it easy for developers to use the Okta API for security and user management in their applications.

Besides blogging here, I've published a few courses on LinkedIn Learning:

* [Deploying ASP.NET Core applications](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/deploying-asp-dot-net-core-applications)
* [Building and securing RESTful APIs in ASP.NET Core](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/building-and-securing-restful-apis-in-asp-dot-net-core)
* [Static site building with Hugo](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-static-site-building-with-hugo)

I'd be happy to speak at your company or meetup. Get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nbarbettini) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nbarbettini/)!
