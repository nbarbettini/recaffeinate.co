I love presenting to technical (and non-technical!) audiences. There's no better way to truly understand something than to teach it to someone else.

The process of breaking down a difficult topic and presenting it in a way that makes people go "aha!" is challenging, but the lightbulb moment is incredibly rewarding.

I'd love to speak to your group or conference. Feel free to reach out on Twitter!
