## California-born, Texas-raised.

I'm a life-long student, serial entrepreneur, and a self-taught software engineer with experience in .NET, SQL, Angular, Mongo, and front-end design. My languages of choice are C# and JavaScript (in that order).

I currently work for [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com) in San Francisco as a Developer Evangelist for the .NET stack. I like to write about emerging technology that solves problems.

I like to write about:

* [Code](/categories/code/) and how to become a better programmer.
